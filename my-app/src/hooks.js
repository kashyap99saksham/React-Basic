// As we know that we cannot use state in function component
// HOOKS are used when we want to use state in function component
// React provides a few built in Hooks like useState , useEffect etc
 
// RULES OF HOOKS
// always use hooks at the top level of react function , cannot use inside any loop or conditions etc
// Hooks dont work inside class as we know no need of hooks in class ... as states feature is already avail in classes
